# Matrix-Calculator
Matrix calculator console app
### Describtion
That's my final project for Introduction Into Programming Practicum Course in Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski. The project is an implementation of a matrix calculator. It has number of functionalities which the user can use.
### Functionalities
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Multiplication with a number
- Matrices Multiplication
- Matrix Devision with a number
- Finding a Determinant
- Finding Inverse Matrix
- Transpose Matrix
### How to use it
This is a console app. There are 7 functionalities and the user enters the number of the desired operations. Single number referres to an exact operation. Depends on the operations the program asks to enter information about operands. For matrices the user must enter the number of their columns and rows, then to enter their elements. The files contain operands. After entering the needed information, the program prints the result on the console and asks if you want to continue. The user can always exit the program when enters the number which is referred to exit. The user can continue working, the program clears the screen and prints the start menu again.
